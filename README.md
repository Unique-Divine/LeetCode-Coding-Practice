# Master Chef

![Python 3.7+] [![License: MIT]](https://github.com/Unique-Divine/SA-Project/blob/main/LICENSE)

Master Chef consists of two things:
1. A [package] to help with quickly setting up deep learning models in the [PyTorch Lightning][pl] paradigm. 
2. A [programming cookbook][devdungeon-cookbook] for Python, data science, and machine learning.

The idea behind Master Chef was simply to take concise but effectives notes in the form of recipes while learning from working on data science projects. I realized these notes made extremely efficient reference materials for friends and decided to make a repo out of them.

Update '2021-04-27': I've also started making a package of useful tools for quickly getting deep learning models running with as little engineering overhead as possible. This will be done by writing and benchmarking various PyTorch Lightning modules in a similar way to how [Lightning Bolts](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/lightning-bolts) work. I'll include any utility I end up using on various personal projects and research projects if it seems like it would be useful for other people.

<!-- Add details on the contents here. -->


#### 2. Anki Notebook 
This file acts as my [sandbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_(software_development)) for figuring out which items should be studied in Anki and which ones should become reference materials (recipes).

Master Chef = [Master Chief][spartan117] + [Cookbook(s)][devdungeon-cookbook] 

#### TODO
- [ ] Move items over from Anki cookbook
- [ ] Add object-oriented matplotlib API section
