# Master Chef

![Python 3.7+] [![License: MIT]](https://github.com/Unique-Divine/SA-Project/blob/main/LICENSE)


- Short and sweet examples and recipes for Python programming, data science, and machine learning. 
- A [package] to help with quickly setting up deep learning models in the [PyTorch Lightning][pl] paradigm.

The repo and package are called Master Chef because, originally,  the idea here was to learn almost entirely from working directly on projects  and save efficient reference materials and concise notes as [programming cookbooks](https://www.devdungeon.com/cookbook). And, [Master Chief][spartan117] is one of my childhood heroes.

Update '2021-04-27': I've also started making a package of useful tools for quickly getting deep learning models running with as little engineering overhead as possible. This will be done by writing modules and benchmarking PyTorch neural network modules that are meant to integrate with various PyTorch Lightning modules in the same way that  [Lightning Bolts](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/lightning-bolts) work. I'll include almost every utility I end up using on various personal projects and research projects if it seems like it would be useful for other people. 

<!-- Add usage instructions. -->
<!-- Include a demo too.  -->


## Notebooks [[link]](https://github.com/Unique-Divine/Master-Chef/tree/master/notebooks)

#### 1. Data Science Cookbook
- [ ] TODO: Add time series section OR plan out a time series cookbook project.
- [ ] TODO: Add object-oriented matplotlib API section
- Link: [pandas cookbook](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/cookbook.html)

#### 2. Anki Notebook 
This file acts as my [sandbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_(software_development)) for figuring out what things I want to remember in Anki and what things I want to become reference materials (recipes).
