# Master Chef

Short and sweet examples and recipes for Python programming relevant to software engineering interviews, data science, and machine learning.

This repo details my journey of becoming a master chef through writing [programming cookbooks](https://www.devdungeon.com/cookbook).

### Data Science Cookbook (Python)
- Link: [pandas cookbook](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/cookbook.html)
- TODO:
  - Add time series section OR make a time series cookbook.
  - Add object-oriented matplotlib API section
  
### Anki Notebook(s) - Cookbook Generator.ipynb
This file acts as my [sandbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_(software_development)) for figuring out what things I want to remember in Anki and what things I want to become reference materials (recipes).

### LeetCode Practice Problems
  - Interview questions and solutions from LeetCode in Anki card format
